Completed by Sinoth Hlayisani Mabasa.

Overview: This project is using the Titanic Dataset to create a simple statitistical model that will return a conditional survival probabily of a passenger given a condition on a numerical variable from the dataset.

Problem Statement: Build a model that will return a passengers survival chance given a passengers detail as input.

Notebook Structure
The structure of this notebook is as follows:

First, we'll load our data to get a view of the predictor and response variables we will be modeling.
We determine the number of missing values for a specific column
We'll then preprocess our data by imputing missing values, mean in numerical features, and mode in categorical feaures.
We then model the survival probabilty of a passenger given their age, class, gender and so on
Function 1: Missing Values
A function that determines the number of missing entries for a specified column in the dataset. The function should return an int that corresponds to the number of missing entries in the specified column.

Function Specifications:

Should take a pandas DataFrame and a column_name as input and return a int as output.
The int should be the number of missing entries in the column.
Should be generalised to be able to work on ANY dataframe.
Expected Outputs:

total_missing(df,'Age') == 177
total_missing(df,'Survived') == 0
Function 2: Imputation
Write a function that takes in as input a dataframe and a column name, and returns the mean for numerical columns and the mode for non-numerical columns.

Function Specifications:

The function should take two inputs: (df, column_name), where df is a pandas DataFrame, column_name is a str.
If the column_name does not exist in df, raise a ValueError.
Should return as output the mean if the specified column is numerical and return a list of the mode(s) otherwise.
The mean should be rounded to 2 decimal places.
If there is more than one mode for a given non-numerical column, the fuction should return a list of all modes.
Expected Outputs:

calc_mean_mode(df, 'Age') == 29.7
calc_mean_mode(df, 'Embarked') == ['S']
Function 3: Model
We ultimately want to predict the survival chances of the passengers in the testing set. We can start by building a simple model using the data we already have by using conditional probability ! Write a function that returns the survival probability of a passenger, given a condition on a numerical variable from the dataset. The condition will consist of a column_name, a value and a boolean_operator. Possible boolean operators include "<",">", or "==". For example, column_name = "Age", boolean_operator = ">", and value = 40 together form the condition Age > 40.

Function specifications:

The function should make use of the df_clean DataFrame loaded earlier in this notebook.
It should take a numerical column_name string, a boolean_operator string, and a value of type string as input.
It should return a survival likelihood as a number between 0 and 1, rounded to 2 decimal places.
Assume that column_name exists in df_clean.
Expected Outputs:

survival_likelihood(df_clean,"Pclass","==","3") == 0.24
survival_likelihood(df_clean,"Age","<","15") == 0.58
Conclusion
Finding an appropriate strategy to impute missing values is very important to increasing the accuracy of the model you are building.
